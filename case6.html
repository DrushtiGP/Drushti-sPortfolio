  <h3 class="case-title">Amazon Product Search Ranking using Inverted Index and TF-IDF</h3>

  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>
      With millions of products across countless categories, Amazon needs to provide users with fast and highly relevant product search results. 
      A naive linear scan of product descriptions or titles is computationally infeasible due to the massive scale of the catalog and the expectation of sub-second latency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazon’s challenge is to:
      <ul>
        <li>Efficiently retrieve only the subset of products that match the search query.</li>
        <li>Rank them based on their relevance to the user's intent, not just raw text match.</li>
      </ul>
      This is especially difficult due to:
      <ul>
        <li>Varying lengths and styles of product titles/descriptions.</li>
        <li>Ambiguity in user queries (e.g., "apple" could mean fruit or electronics).</li>
        <li>Frequent updates to product listings.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>Significance</h4>
    <p>
      A robust product search system is critical to Amazon’s success:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Accurate results reduce friction and help customers find what they need instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Sales Optimization:</strong> Relevant products ranked higher drive higher click-through and conversion rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Systems must remain fast even as millions of new products are added or updated daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization & Ranking:</strong> Accurate base ranking enables further layers of personalization, like using user history and preferences.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms Used</h4>
    <p class="intro-text">Amazon uses a multi-stage information retrieval pipeline, and at its core are two key techniques:</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Inverted Index (Fast Matching Layer)</h3>
      <p>
        An inverted index maps each unique keyword to the list of product documents where it appears.
        Instead of scanning every product, the search engine directly retrieves relevant product IDs from this index.

    </div>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A hash map where each key is a word and the value is a list of product IDs (posting list).</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Retrieval:</strong> Reduces search space drastically by skipping irrelevant documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Compact & Scalable:</strong> Tokens are indexed once, making it storage-efficient and parallelizable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Complexity:</strong><br>
        Build Time: O(N × L) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Query Time: O(k)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. TF-IDF Scoring (Relevance Ranking Layer)</h3>
      <p>
        TF-IDF ranks the retrieved products based on relevance to the search query. It balances frequency of terms with how unique they are across all products.
      </p>

  </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Term Frequency (TF):</strong> Measures how often a term appears in a product.</li>
        <li><strong>Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):</strong> Reduces importance of common words appearing in many products.</li>
        <li><strong>Relevance Ranking:</strong> Products with higher TF-IDF scores appear higher in search results.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Complexity:</strong><br>
        Scoring Time: O(M × T) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Space: O(N × V)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>How Amazon Uses This in Practice</h4>
    <p>
      Amazon’s product search pipeline includes multiple stages to optimize both speed and relevance:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text Preprocessing:</strong> Tokenize, normalize, and clean product descriptions and titles.</li>
        <li><strong>Inverted Index Lookup:</strong> Retrieve candidate products quickly using keyword matches.</li>
        <li><strong>TF-IDF Ranking:</strong> Rank candidate products based on query relevance.</li>
        <li><strong>Re-ranking:</strong> Incorporate behavioral signals, ratings, and metadata for final ranking.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

<div class="case-subsection">
  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <p>
    <div class="case-subsection">
  <h4>Inferences and Takeaways</h4>
  <p>
    This case study highlights how classic information retrieval techniques like inverted index and TF-IDF continue to power search at massive scales. By avoiding full catalog scans, Amazon ensures efficient query processing even as product volume grows exponentially. Relevance scoring via TF-IDF allows the system to surface not just matching, but meaningful results that align with user intent. Most importantly, this foundation is highly extensible — enabling seamless integration of modern personalization techniques, machine learning rankers, and deep semantic search layers. Together, they deliver a fast, relevant, and scalable search experience across hundreds of millions of products.
