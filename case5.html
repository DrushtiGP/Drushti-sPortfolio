  <h3 class="case-title">Inventory Management</h3>

  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>Problem Statement :</h4>
    <p>
      During large-scale sales events like <strong>Amazon Prime Day</strong>, millions of items experience volatile demand patterns. Managing inventory in real time is crucial to avoid stockouts (losing sales) or surpluses (tying up capital). 
      Amazon must accurately forecast product consumption, detect anomalies, and act quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core challenge is maintaining scalable, real-time inventory trend analysis and predicting future demand with minimal lag. 
      This requires efficient algorithms that can track sales spikes or dips over sliding windows of time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>Significance :</h4>
    <p>
      Real-time forecasting enables Amazon to:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prevent stockouts:</strong> Ensure popular products are always available</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize restocking:</strong> Avoid overstocking low-demand items</li>
        <li><strong>Improve warehouse logistics:</strong> Pre-position inventory near high-demand zones</li>
      </ul>
      These capabilities reduce costs, boost customer satisfaction, and enable faster delivery, especially during high-traffic events.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms Used for Forecasting</h4>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Amazon uses a combination of <strong>sliding windows</strong>, <strong>hash maps</strong>, and <strong>min-heaps</strong> to analyze recent sales activity and forecast trends in near real-time.
    </p>

<div class="card">
  <h3>1. Sliding Window (Time-Series Analysis)</h3>
  <p>
    In fast-paced e-commerce systems like Amazon, inventory and sales data change every second â€” especially during events like Prime Day or lightning deals. 
    To make timely decisions, the system doesnâ€™t need the entire sales history. Instead, it focuses on the **most recent window of time** â€” like the last 5 minutes or last 100 transactions. 
    This is where the <strong>sliding window</strong> technique becomes crucial.
  </p>
  <br>
   <p>
    The sliding window technique processes data in real-time by maintaining a fixed-size view over a continuously updating stream of inventory or sales events. 
    Instead of keeping all historical records, it retains only the most recent and relevant time-bound entries â€” such as the last 5 minutes of product sales â€” and discards outdated information as new data flows in.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Aggregation:</strong> Tracks live product movement and demand by continuously updating as new orders are placed.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Efficient:</strong> Maintains only a small, recent slice of data (e.g., last 60 seconds), making it suitable for high-volume traffic with limited storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Trigger-Based:</strong> Automatically detects drops in stock or surges in demand, enabling dynamic decisions like auto-replenishment or flash discounts.</li>
  </ul>
    <p><strong>Complexity:</strong></p>
    <p>Update: O(1) â€“ Add or remove data points efficiently as time advances</p>
    <p>Window Sum/Average: O(1) â€“ Maintain real-time statistics without recomputing the full window</p>
    <p>Space: O(W) â€“ Store only the latest W data points (where W is the window size)</p>

    <div class="card">
  <h3>2. Hash Maps (Product Frequency & State Tracking)</h3>
  <p>
    Hash maps provide an efficient way to track the real-time state of millions of products in Amazonâ€™s inventory system. 
    Each productâ€™s unique ID acts as a key, mapping to a detailed record that includes current stock levels, cumulative sales count, and timestamps of recent updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach enables instant updates and queries, which is critical for handling rapid order placements and dynamic stock changes during high-traffic events like Prime Day.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Constant-Time Updates:</strong> Quickly adjust stock or sales counters as new transactions occur.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Product Scalability:</strong> Supports millions of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) efficiently without slowing down lookups or updates.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Integration:</strong> Works seamlessly with backend APIs to provide accurate stock availability to customers and internal systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Complexity:</strong></p>
  <p>Insert/Update: O(1)</p>
  <p>Lookup: O(1)</p>
  <p>Space: O(N), where N = total number of products tracked</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>3. Min-Heap (Top-K Stockouts or Fastest Depleting Items)</h3>
  <p>
    Min-heaps serve as a priority queue to efficiently maintain a dynamic list of products that are rapidly running out of stock. 
    By monitoring the slope or rate of inventory depletion, Amazon identifies which items require urgent restocking or redistribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    This structure keeps the "hottest" SKUs at the top, enabling warehouse managers and automated systems to prioritize resources and avoid stockouts that could lead to lost sales.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Top-K Monitoring:</strong> Continuously track the K products with the fastest declining inventory levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Priority Queue Behavior:</strong> Automatically promotes critical items as their depletion rates increase.</li>
    <li><strong>Warehouse Rebalancing:</strong> Facilitates timely movement of stock between locations to optimize availability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Complexity:</strong></p>
  <p>Insert: O(log K)</p>
  <p>Extract Min: O(log K)</p>
  <p>Space: O(K), where K = number of top items tracked</p>
</div>


  <div class="case-subsection">
    <h4>Inferences</h4>
    <p>
      This system ensures Amazon maintains an always-ready inventory pipeline even during unpredictable demand surges. By leveraging low-latency data structures like hash maps and sliding windows, decisions are automated and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Predictive inventory management doesnâ€™t just reduce lost sales â€” it also enhances delivery speed, customer experience, and reduces warehousing inefficiencies, especially critical during high-impact sales events like Prime Day.
